# COMP2150_Project
This was my project for COMP2150: Object Oriented Programming from summer 2021. I had to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between 2 given nodes. There are 3 different .txt files of different lengths to show that it will find the path if there are only a few nodes or if there are arbitrarily many of them.
